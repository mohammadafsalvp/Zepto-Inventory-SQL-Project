In this project, I analyzed inventory data from Zepto, a quick-commerce platform known for delivering groceries in minutes. The goal was to dive into the raw data using SQL Workbench, clean it up, and uncover insights that could help a business make smarter decisions—like which products are running out of stock, which categories generate the most revenue, and where discounts are being used effectively.

Working with the dataset felt like looking behind the scenes of a digital storefront. I encountered real challenges like missing values, inconsistent pricing, and products with zero price tags. Step by step, I cleaned the data, added meaningful columns, and ran a series of SQL queries to answer questions any retailer might ask, such as:

Which items give the best bang for your buck?

What’s driving the most revenue?

Are we missing out by not stocking high-demand products?

Through this process, I learned how raw product data can tell powerful stories—from identifying top-performing categories to spotting opportunities to improve pricing strategies or restocking decisions. This project showcases how SQL isn't just about databases—it's a tool for driving business value through data.
